# BmsBoardSoftware
This is the software for Gryphon's BMS. As of Apr 02, 2017, the following functionality is implemented:

-Communication with and cell voltage readings from LTC6803

-Measurement of pack current and voltage

-Communication with power board and ultimately base station

-Overcurrent shutoff

-Manual fan and pack power control via base station

-Single-drop communication with and temperature readings from the DS18B20 one-wire temperature sensor

-Temperature sensing and temperature-based fan control

-Idle shutoff and Estop alarm   

TODO:

-Determine handling for comm errors etc.

-Transmission of voltages to indicator board

-Fix fuel gauge interaction

-Fix ADC scaling for LTC readings and/or find causes of noise (or more likely, get a working LTC chip...)


It is recommended to create your own project, import the source files, and solve the linker and compiler search path issues in your own way.
